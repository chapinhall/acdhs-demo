### Load and--if necessary--install packages ----------------------------------#
package.list <- c("flexdashboard", "data.table", "dplyr", "stringr", "rgdal",
                  "MASS", "plotly", "leaflet")
for (p in package.list){
  if (!p %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]) install.packages(p)
  library(p, character.only = TRUE)
}

### Load custom functions -----------------------------------------------------#
grepv <- function(p, x, ...) grep(p, x, value = TRUE, ...)
cn <- function(x) colnames(x)

```

### Case-Level Visualization

![](img/viz_sentiment-cans-status.png)

***

<ul>
<li> This figure combines
  <ul>
  <li> text-mined sentiment score
  <li> text-mined key topics of relevance
  <li> indication of institutional contacts, including DHS investigation and intervention
  </ul>
<li> Low sentiment scores could be used to flag potential consultation opportunities with a nurse or substance abuse counselor, when combined with key topic combinations
<li> Topic and sentiment scores can help supervisors consider check-in priority and frequency, and quickly review case trajectories
<li> Persistence of key topics can raise flags to QA teams to complete additional modules, e.g. related to housing concerns
</ul>

### System-Level Trajectory Visualization

![](img/dually-involved-youth_traj-viz_3-cluster.png)

***

* Trajectory visualizations can show pathways of cases through institutional contacts
* This combined plot shows how clustering methods were used to classify clients into distinct groupings based on the start, duration, intermittence, and types of involvements

### System-Level Topic Map

```{r display zipcode map with topic layers}
# Get zipcode boundary data
zips <- readOGR(dsn = "data", layer = "Allegheny_County_Zip_Code_Boundaries", verbose = FALSE)

* Dynamic maps offer panning, zooming, and "popup" annotations that allow exploration of geographic trends in various case topics and combinations thereof, such as "opiod" and "overdose"
* This map shows an example of multiple topic layers for Alleghency county zip codes, with more information available through clicking
